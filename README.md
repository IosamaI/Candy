## Project Overview

The **Museum of Candy** website aims to provide visitors with information about the museum, ticketing options, and other relevant details. The homepage features a visually appealing header with candy-themed images and a navigation bar for easy browsing. The website adapts responsively to different screen sizes and includes information about the museum in a fun and colorful design.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structuring the content and layout of the website.
- **CSS3**: Custom styling using `app.css` to give the website a candy-themed design.
- **Bootstrap 4**: For responsive design and easy-to-use navigation bar.
- **jQuery**: For implementing smooth scroll effects and dynamic interactions.
- **Font**: Google Fonts - *Nunito* font for a clean and modern look.
  
## Features

1. **Responsive Navigation**: The navbar collapses into a hamburger menu on mobile devices, ensuring a seamless experience across all screen sizes.
2. **Visually Rich Content**: Sections with images and text that offer a colorful and fun design that matches the candy theme.
3. **Sticky Navigation Bar**: The navbar stays fixed at the top as the user scrolls, providing easy access to navigation links.
4. **Interactive Effects**: The navbar changes its background color when scrolling, making it visually engaging.
5. **Candy-Themed Aesthetic**: Custom colors and candy-related images (like lollipops and sprinkles) enhance the overall look and feel.

## File Descriptions

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that structures the webpage. It contains the content, navigation bar, and sections like "Home", "About", and "Tickets".
- **app.css**: The custom CSS file responsible for styling the webpage. It includes the candy-themed design, font styling, responsive layout adjustments, and scroll-related effects.
- **imgs/**: Directory containing images used in the website, such as candy icons, background images, and other visuals.
- **External Libraries**:
  - **Bootstrap 4**: Used for quick and responsive design elements.
  - **jQuery**: Included for scroll effects and dynamic features.

## Instructions for Running


 **Open the project in your browser**:
    - Simply navigate to the `index.html` file and open it in your preferred web browser to view the website.
  
 **Edit the content**:
    - You can modify text, images, and styles by editing the respective files (`index.html` and `app.css`).

## Additional Requirements

1. **Web Browser**: Any modern web browser such as Chrome, Firefox, or Safari is recommended.
2. **Internet Connection**: For loading Bootstrap and jQuery from CDNs.
3. **Text Editor**: Recommended for modifying the HTML and CSS files. Editors like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom work well.

## Project Distinctiveness & Complexity

This project stands out due to its simple yet visually engaging design. It captures the essence of a "Candy Museum" through its candy-themed layout, playful text, and image elements. While the website is not overly complex in functionality, the use of Bootstrap for responsive layout and dynamic effects via jQuery demonstrates an efficient use of modern web development techniques.

The design adapts smoothly to various screen sizes, making it a user-friendly site for both mobile and desktop users. Additionally, the sticky navigation bar and scroll effects make navigation feel intuitive and modern.
